# Mumbai-International-Airport-MySQL-
# MySQL and Power BI Dashboard Project

This project contains:
1. A SQL file (`PROJECT.sql`) that contains the database schema and queries.
   The data in this file is dummy and created by me. The dataset consists of all the informationof flight passengers boarding flights from Mumbai Airport.
   The database is named BOM.
   The database consists of 5 tables namely
   TERMINAL(the terminals of the airport),
   AIRLINE(the airline information),
   FLIGHT(all the information about the flight including the id, timings),
   PASSENGER(all the general informtaion about the passenger) &
   TICKET(all the information about the journey like the class, date, passportno of passengers).
   All these tables are joined using SQL joins to form a schema, resulting in a dataset.







   
3. A Power BI dashboard (`Project Dashboard.pbix`) created using the data from the SQL file.
   This is a Power BI dashboard that analyses the general metrics of the data like the frequently travelled places, the airlines that are majorly opted, the time of the year when the more 
   flights are booked.
   This analysis help to gain insights about the data and improve the customer retention rate and passenger statisfaction.
